# ðŸš— Self-Driving Car Software Project

Welcome to the `cs386-a2.1` repository! This project simulates how software engineers plan and manage development work using GitHub Issues. Weâ€™re using a self-driving car system as the case study. Made by me John Zeledon

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on:

- Writing and organizing **feature requests** and **bug reports**
- Using **labels** to classify issue types and components
- Assigning issues to **milestones** (`Release 1.0`, `Release 2.0`)
- Assigning team members to issues and collaborating through comments
- Tracking progress through **closed issues**

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

| Section         | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Issues`        | 4 per team member: 2 features, 2 bugs            |
| `Labels`        | Type (`bug`, `enhancement`) + system components  |
| `Milestones`    | Organize issues into `Release 1.0` and `2.0`     |
| `Assignees`     | Track who is responsible for what                |
| `Mentions`      | Use `@username` to discuss issues                |
| `References`    | Link issues using `#issueNumber`                 |

## âœ… Key Learning Outcomes

This project helped me understand how real software teams use GitHub to plan, discuss, assign, and track development tasksâ€”without writing a single line of code.
